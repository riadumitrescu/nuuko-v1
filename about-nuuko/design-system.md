# Nuuko Design System (Web + App)

This document defines the aesthetic and experiential foundation of Nuuko.  
It focuses on **colors, fonts, vibe, and component style**, not pixel-perfect specs.  
Use it to ensure a consistent “storybook journaling” feel across app and web.

## Brand Principles
- **Cozy & Safe** → Feels like a warm notebook or storybook, not a productivity dashboard.  
- **Grounded & Emotional** → Earthy tones, book-inspired textures, subtle illustrations.  
- **Simple & Modern for Gen Z** → Clean typography, soft shapes, minimal friction.  
- **Celebrates Reflection** → Design rewards showing up, not performance.

## Color Palette
- **Green (#6B8F71)** → Growth, positivity, encouragement  
- **Clay (#9A6B51)** → Warmth, human touch, highlights  
- **Espresso (#3D342C)** → Core text, anchors, icons  
- **Cream (#F3EFE5)** → Backgrounds, cards, paper feel  
- **Stone (#8D877E)** → Muted text, borders, secondary UI  

**Overall vibe:** warm, muted, natural — like the tones of a library or a favorite book.  
No harsh contrasts; balance between cream surfaces and dark anchors.

## Typography
- **Primary font:** *Inter* → clean, modern, approachable (body text, UI, captions).  
- **Secondary font:** *Crimson Pro* → elegant serif with storybook feel (headlines, highlights, quotes).  

**Tone of typography:**  
- *Inter* = clear and accessible  
- *Crimson Pro* = poetic, cozy, emotional

## Components & Visual Language
- **Cards** → Rounded, soft shadows, cream background. Feels like journal pages or book cards.  
- **Buttons** → Rounded-pill shape, solid fills in green or clay, soft hover glow.  
- **Inputs (journaling fields)** → Spacious, cream background, inset feel (like paper).  
- **Mood Picker** → Emoji chips, rounded, playful but minimal.  
- **Charts/Insights** → Simple pastel bars and circles, no harsh gridlines, rounded edges.  
- **Illustrations** → Minimal, flat with hand-drawn feel (books, lamps, shelves, plants, sparkles).  

---

## Motion & Interaction
- **Easing:** Gentle, natural transitions (fade, slide).  
- **Feedback:** Subtle hover glows, soft scale up.  
- **Onboarding:** Swipe/slide cards with cozy illustrations.  
- **Calm over flashy:** no harsh or fast animations.  

---

## Voice & Tone
- **Encouraging:** “Nice start 🌱” instead of “Entry saved.”  
- **Supportive:** Nudges, not pressure.  
- **Simple & Relatable:** “Patterns,” “Reflections” instead of “Analytics.”  
- **Personal:** Copy should feel warm, not instructional.  

---

## Imagery & Aesthetic
- Inspired by: bookshelves, journals, cozy corners, hand-drawn illustrations.  
- Neutral background → pops of green/clay for accents.  
- Emotional metaphors: ✨ 🌱 📖 sprinkled lightly for warmth.
