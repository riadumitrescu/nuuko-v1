# What is Nuuko?

Nuuko is an **emotion-centered journaling app** designed for Gen Z.  
It creates a **safe, cozy, storybook-like space** where people can express feelings, reflect on patterns, and build long-term emotional awareness.

---

## Purpose
- Encourage people to **actually journal**, not just sign up.  
- Provide **immediate value** after the first entry (reflection, teaser insights).  
- Help users **notice emotional patterns over time** through gentle, delayed insights.  
- Create a space that feels **warm and personal**, not like a productivity tracker.  
- Support emotional growth through **safe, private, non-performative journaling**.

---

## Key Principles
- **Local-first**: Journaling works without an account (entries saved on device).  
- **Emotion-centered**: Mood pickers, reflections, and insights focus on feelings.  
- **Cozy & Storybook-like**: Cream backgrounds, serif headers, soft illustrations.  
- **Delayed AI**: Reflections and insights come after time, never intrusive.  
- **Streaks as encouragement**: Streaks celebrate consistency without guilt.

## Audience
- Primarily **Gen Z (18‚Äì25)**, introspective, digital-native, drawn to cozy aesthetics.

- Users who value **emotional self-awareness** but dislike performative or gamified apps.

## Why It Matters
Most journaling apps either:  
- Force sign-up before writing (high drop-off).  
- Emphasize productivity, not emotions.  
- Lack warmth or aesthetic appeal.  

Nuuko fills the gap by:  
- Letting users **start journaling instantly**.  
- Focusing on **feelings over performance**.  
- Making journaling feel **inviting, warm, and rewarding**.
