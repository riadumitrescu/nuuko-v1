# nuuko assets guide

this guide explains how to use nuuko’s visual assets consistently.  
assets are grouped into three categories: **character**, **icons**, and **illustrations**.  
the goal is to make sure visuals feel cohesive, cozy, and intentional.  

---

## 1. character
**folder:** `/assets/character`  
examples:  
- `feather-character.svg`  
- `calm-feather-character.svg`  
- future variants: `happy-feather-character.svg`, `thoughtful-feather-character.svg`, `celebrating-feather-character.svg`  

### role
the feather character is nuuko’s **companion**.  
it acts like duolingo’s owl, but softer and more reflective:  
- supportive, never nagging  
- appears at meaningful touchpoints, not constantly  
- helps bring warmth, personality, and encouragement  

### emotional states
the feather will eventually have **multiple emotional expressions**, used in different contexts:  
- **calm** → onboarding, quiet reflections, empty states  
- **happy/celebrating** → streak milestones, wrapped summaries, first entry celebration  
- **thoughtful** → after journaling, during insights preview, prompting deeper reflection  
- **gentle encouragement** → when user has a gap in journaling, framed positively  

### when to use
- onboarding → feather welcomes the user, introduces nuuko  
- first journaling → feather acknowledges the first page written  
- streaks → feather lightly celebrates consistency (never guilt-tripping for breaks)  
- wrapped → feather guides the user through monthly/seasonal summary cards  
- insights → feather may appear with a thoughtful pose, reinforcing the reflective nature  

### how to use
- medium-to-large presence in key flows (not tiny icons)  
- should feel alive and emotionally attuned, not cartoonish or loud  
- each emotional state should match the **tone of the copy** (calm copy = calm feather)  
- usage should feel intentional — feather appears like a companion showing up at the right time, not a system mascot everywhere

## 2. icons
**folder:** `/assets/icons`  
example: `streak-icon.svg`  

- functional, minimal line-based symbols  
- used for navigation, card markers, or small cues  
- default color: espresso/stone; may use green/clay for highlights  
- simple and legible at small sizes  

---

## 3. illustrations
**folder:** `/assets/illustrations`  
example: `lamp-illustration.svg`  

- cozy contextual visuals (lamps, bookshelves, paper, plants)  
- used in onboarding slides, empty states, or to decorate sections  
- should never overwhelm content — always secondary to text and journaling  
- aligns with nuuko’s warm palette and rounded aesthetic  

---

## 4. when to use what
- **character** → emotional moments and guidance  
- **icons** → functional UI cues  
- **illustrations** → decorative storytelling and context  

---

## 5. future asset expansions
- **additional feather states** (sad, playful, curious)  
- **patterns/textures** for backgrounds (subtle paper grain)  
- **stickers/badges** for wrapped and milestones  
- **animations** (gentle svg/lottie) for feather movements or onboarding slides  

---

## 6. general rules
- keep usage **minimal and intentional** — less is more  
- assets should always feel like part of one cozy, bookish world  
- prefer svg for crisp scaling; png only for textures or raster details
