# nuuko copy & voice guide

nuuko should always sound like a gentle, cozy friend.  
words should feel supportive, human, and easy to read.  
no corporate jargon, no over-explaining, no harsh tones.  
keep everything lowercase unless a proper noun really needs it.

- warm → gentle encouragement, never pressure  
- simple → avoid technical terms like “analytics” or “dashboard”  
- subtle playfulness → pair text with small illustrations or icons (sprout, sparkle, book, lamp, feather)
